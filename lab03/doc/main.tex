% {{{ Introduction
\section{Introduction}

A bus is used to allow communication with multiple devices
over a shared set of wires.
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) provides a means
for transferring data between two devices.
This project shows how an ARM board can communicate over
SPI to a CPLD which defines a bus.
Figure \ref{fig:bus} gives an overview.

There are two main components used in this project which
will be referred to in an abbreviated form throughout this document.
The term "ARM" will refer to the ARM STM32L Discovery\cite{UM1079} board.
And the term "CPLD" will refer to the Lattice MachXO\cite{EB66}
CPLD board.
This project is specific to these development boards although it
may be possible to substitute others with some modification.

\begin{figure}[hbp]

\caption{Conceptual overview of bus and related components.
The ARM is only able to communicate with the bus through the SPI
module.
And all the components which are on the bus are controlled by the
CPLD.
Arrows designate input/output and if there are none it is bidirectional.
Refer to table \ref{tbl:memmap} for the specific address used.

% {{{ Bus Interface
\section{Bus Interface}
\label{sec:bus}

Before we can communicate with the bus over SPI we need
to define how the bus itself works.
There are two main operations that must be supported: read and write.

For a read cycle the first step is to drive the address value.
Then the device is enabled and some time later read is enabled.
At this point the device knows it should it should drive the
data but it will take some time for it to become valid.
After the data has been read the cycle is finished and the device is disabled.
Figure \ref{fig:bus_cycle} (a) shows this read cycle.

For a write cycle the first step is to drive the address value.
Then the device is enabled and some time later write is enabled.
At this point the data should be driven by the bus master
but it will take some time to become valid.
At the end of the write strobe, before it is disabled,
the data should be latched by the device.
Figure \ref{fig:bus_cycle} (b) shows this write cycle.

\end{tabular}

\caption{Bus read cycle (a) and write cycle (b).}
\label{fig:bus_cycle}
\end{figure}

A decoder will be used to control the chip enable for all the components
to ensure only one is driving the bus at any given time (Figure \ref{fig:bus}).

% }}}

% {{{ SPI protocol
\section{SPI protocol}
\label{sec:spi}

Since the ARM cannot connect directly to the bus the SPI
is used as a communication channel.
The read and write operations that need to be performed
require a minimum of two bytes.
A read, for example, would send the address in the first transaction.
And in the second transaction the data read would be returned.
A write is similar except that for the second transaction the
data to be written is sent.
The format of the bytes for each transaction is shown in Table \ref{tbl:spiformat}.

\begin{table}[hbp]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \multicolumn{1}{l}{8} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{7} & \multicolumn{1}{r}{1} \\
\hline
rw bit & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{address} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{data} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Format of two byte SPI transactions.}
\label{tbl:spiformat}
\end{table}

Note, this implementation is configured with the SPI settings
shown in Table \ref{tbl:spi}.
Both the ARM and the CPLD must use these same settings in order
to work properly with each other.

\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	option & value \\
	\hline
	MSB & first \\
	CPOL & 0 \\
	CPHA & 0 \\
	NSS & slave select\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{SPI configuration options}
\label{tbl:spi}
\end{table}

In order to perform a read/write the timing of the bus operations
(Figure \ref{fig:bus_cycle}) needs to be integrated in to the
timing of SPI operations.
The result is showing in Figure \ref{fig:spi_read} for the
read operation and in Figure \ref{fig:spi_write} for the write.

For a detailed timing diagram of the read and write operations refer
to Figures \ref{fig:spi_read} and \ref{fig:spi_write}.

% {{{ User Interface
\section{User Interface}

In order for the user to be able to perform read and write
operations to the bus devices an interface needs to be defined.
The only means of input is using an eight position DIP switch
and a USER button.
Outputs are provided by an LCD, a bar of eight LEDS,
and a group of eight LEDs on board the CPLD.

The bar of LEDs and the group of LEDs on the CPLD both operate
similarly.
They act as an eight bit register which can be read from and written to.
Refer to Table \ref{tbl:memmap} for their specific addresses.

The LCD is the primary means of user feedback.
It instructs the user when to enter a command or data and
it displays the results.
Figure \ref{fig:armstate} gives an overview of the states of
the system.

\begin{figure}[hbp]
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/arm-state_diagram/arm-state_diagram}
\caption{State diagram of ARM board operation.
The states 'display\_results', 'enter\_cmd' and 'enter\_data'
wait for the USER button to be pressed before continuing.
'read\_cmd' reads the input switches to get the command (address and rw bit).
If the command is a write 'read\_data' reads the switches again to get the data.
And 'execute' performs the read/write command.
}
\label{fig:armstate}
\end{figure}

As an example of reading the switches.
Notice that the only difference is the inclusion of the
rw bit as part of the data value whereas the address
is only 7-bits and excludes this part.

% {{{ Pin Assignments, Schematics
\section{Pin Assignments, Schematics}
\label{sec:pa}

The pin assignments define all the interconnecting wires
between the ARM, CPLD and other components.

% describe the pin meanings
To locate a pin on the CPLD requires two designations\citep[Pg. 11-14]{EB66}.
The first is the header which has names such as J9, J7, etc.
And the second is the number of the pin.
The board will have pin numbers at the beginning and end of a header
to denote the orientation.

On the CPLD the pins correspond to headers (J9, J7, etc)
and pins within those headers\citep[Pg. 11-14]{EB66}.
The header and pin numbers are printed at the end of each header.

When specifying the pin constraints in Diamond\cite{Diamond}
the header and pin number are not available.
Instead the "Mach XO Ball" must be specified.
And this value is included in the following pin assignments.

The pin assignments are given in Tables
\ref{tbl:ramcommon}, \ref{tbl:rampinsuniq}, \ref{tbl:pins}
as well as the schematic in Figures \ref{fig:ram_to_cpld}, \ref{fig:arm_to_cpld}.

% configuring using Diamond
In Diamond the pins were configured with standard options:
low voltage 3.3 volt CMOS with no pull up or pull down.
Output pins to drive the leds were configured for 8 mA drive current.

% input switches
The input switches to the CPLD can be interfaced by connecting
one end to ground and the other end to the pin along with a
pull up resistor to Vdd.
A resistor value between 1k and 10k should be acceptable.
And the pull up voltage for Vdd can be sourced from a pin on
the board (Table \ref{tbl:pins}).

% output leds
The output LEDs are connected to the CPLD using a series
resistor.
Vdd would connect to the resistor which connects to the led
(forward biased) which connects to the pin.
The value of the resistor should limit the current to approximately
10 mA.
A value of 300 $\ohm$ is a typical value.

% reset pin
To reset the boards their reset pins must be configured.
The ARM board provides a \verb+NRST+ pin which is at Vcc
when enabled and goes low when the reset button is pushed\cite[Pg. 17, 20]{UM1079}.
This can then be connected to the CPLD to cause
it to reset using \verb+GSRN+\citetext{\citealp[Pg. 13, 46, 50, 53]{DS1002}; \citealp[Pg. 8]{EB66}}.
Table \ref{tbl:pins} lists the pins that were used.

% {{{ Development
\section{Development}

While the end result of this project is simple its development
was far from easy.

% sythesis
All the code to control the CPLD was written in Verilog.
While Verilog is a rich language with numerous
capabilities\cite{thomas2002verilog} only a small fraction of it
can be synthesized in to functional code.
It was often trivial to devise a solution
but the code had to be significantly reworked in order to get it to
synthesize\footnote{The term "synthesize" is used to describe when
the Verilog code is processed under strict rules by a program such
as Diamond or Synplify.  Simulating the code under Icarus Verilog
is not considered "synthesizing" because it is far less strict.}.

As an example of one of one of the common synthesis problems,
suppose it was desired to increment a variable on the rising
edge and falling edge of a clock.
The Verilog simulator (Icarus) will allow this and it will simulate
properly.
But this code can't be synthesized because it can't be turned in to a flip flop.

As another example, suppose it was desired to reset all the variables on
a falling edge of the NSS signal, and then mutate the variables during
subsequent rising edges of the SCK signal.
Again this will simulate properly but it cannot be synthesized because
two different always blocks cannot modify the same variable.

% debugging
The problems that occurred during development were numerous and intricate.
Without a full arsenal of debugging techniques this project is nearly impossible.
For the simple problems "trial and error" could be used but more
often this was impractical.
A logic analyzer with a minimum of four channels was invaluable for
diagnosing errors with SPI communications such as glitches and shifts.
A C debugger was crucial for stepping through the ARM code
to verify that it is behaving as expected.
And Diamond provides a debugger for the CPLD which could have
been helpful if it was easier to get working.
